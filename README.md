This Solidity program is a simple "MyToken" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to create our own token of whatever name we want and want to get a feel for how it works.

DESCRIPTION:
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a mainly Two function that are "Mint" and "Burn" function, which is used to mint and burn the values. there are public variables like string, uint, etc, and even has the mapping of addressses to balances. This program is a simple and straightforward to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
